# FlowVQA: Advancing Visual Question Answering with Flowcharts ðŸŒŠðŸ¤”ðŸ’¡

## Welcome to the FlowVQA Project Repository

FlowVQA introduces a novel benchmark for visual question answering, emphasizing the use of flowcharts for complex reasoning and evaluation. This benchmark aims to challenge and enhance the capabilities of multimodal language models through spatial reasoning, decision-making, and logical progression tasks.

## Abstract
Traditional benchmarks in visual question answering do not fully test models' visual grounding and complexity, especially in spatial reasoning. FlowVQA addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive set of 2,272 human-verified flowchart images and 22,413 question-answer pairs. This new benchmark is designed for a thorough evaluation of visual and logical reasoning capabilities in AI.
